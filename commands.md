## Can you give me the commands used to create the virtualbox which is based on vagrant box?

Sure, here are the basic commands to create a VirtualBox virtual machine based on a Vagrant box:

- Install Vagrant and VirtualBox on your machine if you haven't already.

- Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using your terminal or command prompt.

- Initialize Vagrant in the directory using the vagrant init command followed by the name of the Vagrant box you want to use. For example:
`vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64`
This will create a new Vagrantfile in your directory, which you can edit to customize your virtual machine's settings.

- Run the vagrant up command to create and start the virtual machine. Vagrant will download the box image if it's not already on your system, and then start up the virtual machine using VirtualBox.
`vagrant up`

- Once the virtual machine is running, you can connect to it using the vagrant ssh command.
`vagrant ssh`

That's it! You now have a fully functional virtual machine based on a Vagrant box running in VirtualBox.
